Project Title: TextClassifierML – TF-IDF,ML & Ensemble for AI vs Human

A dataset was taken from Kaggle, where texts were labeled as AI-written or human-written. Different language and style features were extracted from each text. The dataset was prepared for machine learning to classify AI and human content.

It was made with 17 features and 1367 rows. The target column was label (1 = AI, 0 = Human). Texts of many types were included for binary classification.

The project was conducted under the title TextClassifierML – TF-IDF, ML & Ensemble for AI vs Human. TF-IDF was used in both machine learning and hybrid methods. In the hybrid approach, TF-IDF was combined with numeric features. Ensemble learning with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN was applied to evaluate classification performance.
